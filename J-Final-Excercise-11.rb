I would go for the class Exception with its begin-rescue-end statements, I didn't
know that such a thing existed in programming and it turns out to be a great tool.

I also did like a lot the File.new("newfile", "a+"). Actually I used it to create the 
17 files in this last section of the book. All files had the same name except the
number. I made a small program that created those (0-16)+1 files and well, it has
been my first REAL PROGRAM, not just an excercise.
