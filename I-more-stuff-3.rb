=begin 

Exceptions are errors when programming. The lines given when an error ocurres
allow the programmer to identify, to track back trhough the code, the beginning
of the erro and the end (<main>).

There are ways to "jump" a specific section of the code in case an error is given,
this provides with the continuity of the code without crashing

=end
